# Magic 8 Ball – Python Project

A simple Python program that simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. Ask a question, and the program randomly selects and returns an answer—just like the physical version many of us remember!

---

## Features

- Mimics the behavior of a real Magic 8 Ball  
- Provides randomized responses  
- Simple and interactive command-line interface  
- Beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating:
  - random module usage  
  - input handling  
  - conditional logic and loops  

---

## How to Run

```bash
python magic_8_ball.py

Example Usage

Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question: Will I become a Python developer?
Magic 8 Ball says: “Signs point to yes”

random module Generates random responses

Learning Highlights

This project helped me practice:
	•	Python basics (syntax, input/output)
	•	Random number and choice generation
	•	Creating interactive programs
	•	Writing clean and readable code

Future Improvements
	•	Add a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
	•	Allow multiple questions without restarting
	•	Store user questions and responses in a file
	•	Turn into a small web app with Flask
